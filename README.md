## Documentation
The wiki has been completly reworked and is now available on [readthedocs.io](https://py-kms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). It should provide you all the necessary information about how to setup and to use _py-kms_ , all without clumping this readme. The documentation also houses more details about activation with _py-kms_ and how to get GVLK keys.
